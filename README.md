How to merge bigwig files without BigWigMerge

Have you ever found yourself with two bigwig files with the forward and reverse alignment post RNA seq and you needed to merge them both and bigWigmerge was being a trouble because your Ubuntu is not updated? Well I found myself in such position and to wait another day for the person who shared the files to merge and send it to me, I did not have so much time.
So with the power of my very underdeveloped brain and readily available LLM tools I have this code. Not the best code but it does the work pretty well. Use it if you need to merge it.
